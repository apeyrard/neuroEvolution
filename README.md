Training of neural networks with genetic algorithms

## What is done :
Feed-forward neural network implementation
Training with back-propagation doesn't work

## To do :
1. Automate unit tests with google test
2. clean code when back-propagation works
3. Profiling of code, then optimization id needed
4. Implement genetic algorithm
5. Extend to non-Feed forward nns
